# Trezor_Express_Card
 A stealthy 3D-printable replacer for the express card slot that can hold your crypto wallet.

For this to work you will have to remove the plastic shell from your trezor, this can be done via razor for example if you slice along the sides.

I implemented some tolerances so it should print well straight out of the box with various materials, personally I use PETG.
